##  Overview

The Unified Wallet Kit is an open-source, Swiss Army Knife wallet adapter designed to streamline your development on Solana. This wallet kit is purpose built to help ease the burdens of integrating multiple wallets with seamless UI/UX into your custom program. Make your development process faster and more efficient with Jupiterâ€™s Unified Wallet Kit.

The Unified Wallet Kit will help you reduce repetitive tasks within your development process, including:

- Implementing a mobile-friendly wallet connector 

The Unified Wallet Kit eliminates redundancies by providing these building blocks in a simple, plug-and-play package. This allows developers to focus on what matters most, building innovative features for your dApp.

```jsx
const ExampleBaseOnly = () => {
  return (
    <UnifiedWalletProvider
      wallets={[]}
      config={{
        autoConnect: false,
        env: 'mainnet-beta',
        metadata: {
          name: 'UnifiedWallet',
          description: 'UnifiedWallet',
          url: 'https://jup.ag',
          iconUrls: ['https://jup.ag/favicon.ico'],
        },
        notificationCallback: WalletNotification,
        walletlistExplanation: {
          href: 'https://station.jup.ag/docs/additional-topics/wallet-list',
        },
      }}
