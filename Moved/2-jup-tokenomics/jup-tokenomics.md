# Governance and Community Engagement
- Governance in regards to DAO actions takes place utilizing the $JUP token as the vote count mechanism. 1 $JUP = 1 Vote
- The LFG Launchpads' voting process also hinges on $JUP holder votes to select projects to launch. 75% of the fees generated from the launchpad are returned to the users who vote, in the form of ASR or Active Staking Rewards. 100mm $JUP has been injected into the ASR pool as an additional reward for Voters in the first two quarters of voting. 
- ASR, or Active Staking Rewards takes into account the activity of $JUP holders as they participate in the governance and launchpad processes to allocate rewards to active community members that have staked and vote on DAO actions.
