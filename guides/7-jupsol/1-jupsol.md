# JupSOL Liquid Staking Token

JupSOL represents staked Solana (SOL) tokens with Jupiter’s validator, which is hosted and managed by Triton. Jupiter passes all validator rewards collected and 100% of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) along to stakers for maximum yield. The JupSOL token is issued through Sanctum.

Review the official JupSOL Announcement forum post [Here](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jupsol-jupiter-staked-sol/14666).

## How does JupSOL work?

SOL that’s deposited into JupSOL is staked. The staking rewards from that SOL accrue to the JupSOL token, which starts at 1:1 with SOL and grows in value over time. For example, if staking rewards are 10% annually, then after a year, 1 JupSOL = 1.10 SOL. By simply holding JupSOL, you will earn staking rewards.

### Where does the yield come from?

JupSOL earns staking yields and MEV kickbacks from Jupiter’s validator, and has no fees.

Additionally, the Jupiter team will be delegating 100K SOL to the Jupiter validator, and using the yields to enhance the APY of JupSOL to reward Jupiter’s users. Expect to see higher than average APYs on JupSOL compared to regular LSTs.

## What are the fees on JupSOL?

- 0% withdrawal fee

### Is JupSOL safe?

JupSOL is powered by the SPL stake pool program. The SPL stake pool program is one of the safest programs in the world; it has been audited multiple times, is used by the largest stake pools like jitoSOL and bSOL, and has secured more than $1B of staked SOL over more than two years without an issue.

The program authority is secured by a multisig that includes, among others, members from Sanctum, Jupiter, Mango, marginfi and Jito. Any changes to the program will have to be approved by a majority vote from this multisig. No single party can unilaterally change the program. We plan to significantly grow the size of the multisig and eventually freeze the program.

### Why should I buy and hold JupSOL?

Buying and holding JupSOL helps you earn native staking yields on your SOL; this is the “risk-free” rate of SOL. As an extra incentive to hold JupSOL, Jupiter is returning all validator MEV rewards to JupSOL. This should lead to higher APY than native staking.

When you hold JupSOL you also help Jupiter improve its transaction inclusion rate, helping all Jupiter users to more easily swap, DCA or limit order in congested conditions.
